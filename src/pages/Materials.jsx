                The temple covers an area of about 1,020 square meters and shows a unique combination of Chinese and Javanese architectural styles from the 14th century. The building is painted in a bright red color and has a three-layered roof that is typical of East Asian temples. Sam Poo Kong is located on Jalan Simongan. The temple is closely related to Cheng Ho, a famous Chinese Muslim explorer who once visited Java. Today, this temple functions as a place of worship and a historical site to honor Cheng Ho. It is also one of the most popular cultural and religious tourist destinations in Semarang.`,

This place is well known for its beautiful old buildings that were built during the Dutch colonial period. Many of the buildings have unique European architectural styles with large windows, tall doors, and strong walls. Because of its classic atmosphere,  Semarang old town is often called “Little Netherlands.”
                One of the most iconic buildings in this area is the Blenduk Church, which has a large dome and historical value. Currently, Semarang old town has become a popular tourist destination where visitors can walk around, take photos, enjoy cafes, and learn about the history of the city. The area offers a unique combination of history, culture, and beautiful architecture. The good thing is tourists are able to explore them all freely. Most of the buildings apply the Dutch architecture, for sure. In fact, these structures have been there since the 18th century. Despite the age, the condition remains good and sturdy. The appearance doesn’t look too good, though. It is because the local government wants to retain its historical value, so they decided to keep it that way.`,
